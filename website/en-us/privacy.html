				Welcome to VOLTZ ! Our privacy policy describes the information VOLTZ collects when you visit or use its services (both the game and the site), and the ways in which we may use and share it. It only describes our own practices and does not apply to third parties that we do not own or control, such as companies with which you may interact within the framework of our services or through them (especialy EPITA).

                    In the VOLTZ game, we will collect various information necessary for your online connection, in order to allow you a better game experience. If you want to object to this, nothing could be easier! There is what we call "uninstallation". This action will allow you, if you apply it on our game, to interrupt the transmission of information to our services. However, if you are a perfectionist and want to block all external traffic, you can uninstall your OS as well.
