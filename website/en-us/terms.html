                <p>
                    VOLTZ being a game based on cooperation, you will inevitably come into contact with other users. Therefore, we ask you to be moderate in your words and actions when contacting other players, otherwise you will put the whole community of the game (i.e. the person you have met) at fault. On the other hand, VOLTZ declines any responsibility for breaking friendships, just like UNO, Monopoly and many others.
                </p>
                <h3> <span id = "site" class = "h3link">2.</span> REGARDING THE WEBSITE</h3>
                <p>
                    The VOLTZ website is above all a place to collect information. Therefore, the actions concerning its use will remain those of legality in general. Nevertheless, we invite you not to spam the requests on the "CONTACT" tab to allow us to work more efficiently.
