				The VOLTZ project (born in Villejuif, January 11, 2022) is a collaborative video game (no, not that one) combining a puzzle and platform approach, more precisely a Metroidvania. It was the most original game of the S2 project of the 2026 promotion, thanks to an innovative gameplay out of the ordinary.

				Faced with the problems of a world in perdition, we wanted to bring our unique solution, our stone to the building to improve an uncertain future. That's why we decided to bury our heads in the sand, fill in the blanks with text and make a video game instead of devoting ourselves to the creation of an application to help people protect themselves from diseases.
		    </section>
		    <section class = "section4">
				The first problem we encountered when creating this game was to find its basic principles. Once found after a week of cogitation during which we decided that this game would have electricity as its main theme and would be puzzle oriented, a flash of genius was born in Benjamin: the physics and particular mechanics of Voltz, its essence; the cable connecting the two players.
                <br/>
                However, that same lightning spirit was also a challenge for our team. Another member stepped in: Elvin. He exercised this somewhat elastic cable physics, which allows players to keep a maximum of freedom while forbidding them to stray too far from each other, but above all to keep control of their character.
                <br/>
                On the other hand, one obstacle Rayan encountered was setting up online multiplayer. He solved this problem brilliantly with the help of Photon servers. Benjamin continued to work on the visual aspect of the game, including character design and animation, while working with Elvin on the music.
                <br/>
                And the last member, you might say? if his work wasn't as visible as the others', it was the one who created this site. He also served as a mobile part of the team, helping with complex tasks such as network implementation when needed, like a personification of the 203<sup>rd</sup> Aerial Mage Battalion.
